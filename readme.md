# AOP-main

This repository focuses on **entity extraction** and **biological plausibility evaluation** from scientific articles related to Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOP).  
It processes curated data about Key Event Relationships (KERs), extracts relevant biological entities, and evaluates mechanistic plausibility.

## Overview

The project enables the extraction of key biological entities (e.g., stressor, species, evidence levels, correlations) and the evaluation of biological plausibility between events.  
It leverages manually curated ground-truth data to validate the performance of an automated pipeline and stores results in a structured format.

## Repository Structure

- **data_input/** – Input data for entity extraction & evaluation (`Data_evaluatie_accuraatheid_agent_Daan_de_Jong_16-06-2025.csv`) 
- **data_output/** – Contains processed results (e.g., `entities_ner.csv`, `entities_ner.parquet`)  
- **src/** – Source code for entity extraction pipeline (`extract_entities_ner.py`)
## Folders

### `data_input/`
Holds all raw input data for the pipeline.  
Currently includes the Excel file described above, which provides the articles and curated KERs used for downstream entity extraction and plausibility evaluation.

### `data_output/`
Contains processed results after running the pipeline:
- `entities_ner.csv` – Extracted entities in CSV format for quick inspection.
- `entities_ner.parquet` – Same data in Parquet format for efficient processing.

### `src/`
Source code for the entity extraction pipeline:
- `extract_entities_ner.py` – Implements the Named Entity Recognition (NER) workflow, processing article text to extract species, stressors, and key events, and saving them to `data_output/`.
